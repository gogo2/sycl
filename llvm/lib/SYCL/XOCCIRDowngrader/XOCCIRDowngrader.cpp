  /// Removes byval bitcode function parameter attribute that is applied to
  /// pointer arguments of functions to state that they should technically be
  /// passed by value.
  ///
  /// While this attribute has been long standing and has been around since
  /// Clang/LLVM 7 it's diverged in the patch: D62319 which is the tail end of
  /// Clang/LLVM 9.
  ///
  /// This LLVM patch primarily added byval <Type> syntax in the IR. And a new
  /// attribute type, which is not to be confused with anything related to the
  /// type system. It basically just states the attribute is carrying around
  /// some Type/Value information rather than string/int/enum and gives it
  /// somewhere to store it.
  ///
  /// However now the bitcode writer will write out some different bitcode for
  /// byval that is unreadable by xocc and the bitcode reader upgrades any byval
  /// attributes to the new byval <Type> syntax. The way we currently work
  /// around this is:
  /// 1) Delete the ByVal attribute, erasing any byval <Type> syntax in the IR
  /// and then re-adding the old byval with no <Type> Syntax.
  /// 2) In the SYCL xocc script when we run this pass with opt we make sure we
  /// emit LLVM IR assembly language format and not bitcode format after this
  /// pass so that it doesn't run through the bitcode writer.
  /// 3) Inside the script we run it through an earlier LLVM assembler to create
  /// our bitcode, in this case the one packaged with xocc as it's easily
  /// accessible and we don't wish to carry around our own precompiled
  /// assemblers for every architecture in existence. Plus the bitcode it
  /// generates will always be bitcode compatible with xocc..
  /// 4) Feed it to xocc and be happy that it can consume it.
  ///
  /// The downside to this rather painful hack is that we're tied to the LLVM
  /// assembler that's packaged with xocc, which means newer LLVM IR may not be
  /// compatible with it. Which may lead to more problems in the future, one
  /// currently example of this problem is the renameBasicBlocks function inside
  /// this pass that renames all blocks to make the assembler happy. Without it
  /// the xocc llvm-as will die.
  ///
  /// An alternative to this would be to make our own alterations to the Bitcode
  /// writer so that it will optionally output the old bitcode encoding style of
  /// byval so that xocc can still read it in.
  ///
  /// Sadly we cannot just remove the byval attribute and ignore all the hacky
  /// workaround that come with keeping it as even though xocc will allow it to
  /// compile the resulting binary is not compatible with the XRT runtime. It
  /// will kill its execution when the kernel is launched, even for simple
  /// kernels.
